main2.py works with v ≈ 5.6 km/s 

main4.py is currently in development for velocity to be calculated correctly

other mainx.py are just drafts that aren't working

main.py idk what that is. I deleted it several times but reappears all the time so I guess it's main5.py

# Astro Pi Mission Space Lab – example experiment
# Goal: Estimate the speed of the ISS by:
#   1. Taking up to 42 images of Earth in at most 10 minutes.
#   2. Recording the time and orbital data for each image.
#   3. Using OpenCV to match features between consecutive images.
#   4. Estimating ground distance from pixel shifts + altitude.
#   5. Computing speed = distance / time and using a median
#      to remove outliers ("Abweicher").
#
# NOTE:
# - This is example code for you to study and adapt.
# - You must check and adjust:
#     * Camera resolution supported on Astro Pi hardware.
#     * Field of view (FOV) of the camera used in calculations.
#     * Any library imports allowed in this year's rules.
